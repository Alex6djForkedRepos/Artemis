# Artemis
Artemis adds support for several games to a range of RGB keyboards.

Besides game-support there are also a few effects for when you're not gaming. 

**Download**: https://github.com/SpoinkyNL/Artemis/releases

**FAQ**: https://github.com/SpoinkyNL/Artemis/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-(FAQ)

Some of it's basic features:

 * Support for multiple keyboards.
 * Support for multiple games.
 * A few non-gaming effects such as type waves and audio visualization.
 * A fancy, modern looking UI.


Currently the following games are supported:

 * Rocket League (uses memory reading for now, we've had contact with Psyonix for a better solution)
 * The Witcher 3 (uses a mod)
 * Counter-Strike Global Offensive (uses native gamestate intergration)

Support is planned for:
 * Dota 2 (in development right now!)
 * Project CARS (using native memory sharing)
 * What you happen to suggest!

For online games we greatly perfer to use an official API, since memory reading is frowned upon by anti-cheat sofware.

The following keyboards are supported:
 * Corsair K95 RGB
 * Corsair K70 RGB
 * Corsair Strafe RGB
 * Logitech G910
 * Logitech G810 (untested)
 * Logitech G410 (untested)

Razer BlackWidow Chroma support coming soon.

For any keyboards/games/effects we'd love PRs!
